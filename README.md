# Radium - A ZSH prezto theme

I recently started using ZSH and prezto and I wanted to hack a theme to my liking
as well as learn a little more about ZSH. There are many great themes out there
and in fact I have based my theme on several of them. Feel free to use or abuse
this as you see fit.

## Prompt design
- Single line prompt
- User@hostname on the left + on/off toggle with an env var
- Git branch info on the left
- Time since last commit on the left
- Time of execution on the right
- Dynamic prompt blocks
